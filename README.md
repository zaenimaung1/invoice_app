## Description

Invoice App is a lightweight and straightforward invoice generator. It lets you build, preview, and manage invoices in your browser. The goal is to have a clean interface and fast workflow — perfect for freelancers, small businesses, or anyone needing quick invoice creation.

## Features

* Create new invoices with client details, items, tax/discounts.
* View a summary and preview of the invoice.
* Export or print the invoice (depending on browser support).
* Clean & minimal UI for fast use.

## Tech Stack

* Front‑end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Build tool: Vite (via `vite.config.ts`)
* Scripts and dependencies managed via `package.json`
* Project structure: `src/` folder, plus `public/` assets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* You need Node.js (v14+ recommended) and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
* Basic knowledge of command line for running scripts.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaenimaung1/invoice_app.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd invoice_app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This should launch the app in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000` or similar).

## Usage

* Use the interface to enter **Invoice details** (client name, address, date, etc).
* Add **Line items** (description, quantity, rate).
* Apply **tax** or **discounts** if needed.
* Preview your invoice and export or print it.
* Customize styles or template as needed in the `src/` folder.
